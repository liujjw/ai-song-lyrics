Yeah, I've been up six days
Tryna find my place
Place, place, place
I'm reachin' out to home
Home, home, home
Takin' shit down from the seven
With some girls I've never met before
Life of a made man
I prayed I'd never get caught
Okay, but I need you now
Tell me where you at
On the other side of the Papasan
Christmas time, now December's here
And now I'm wonderin' where the fuck I'm at
It's rainin' off the echoes
And I hear it loud
I wanna be free of all of this
I'd rather be rich than famous
But who am I kiddin'?
It's still a tough decision
'Cause I'm hungry
And sometimes I get it mistaken
Wakin' up with a grammy
And dedication
And fixed dinners
And my real vision
On a platinum mission
I love the woosah cows
I'm straight from California
