Niggas make threats, can't hear 'em over the laughter, 
Surprised at what I do, they under-anticipate my chapter
"Had to let the beat rock," no microphones but a rapper
Bitches lovin' my drive, I bet them shits woulda popped if I was willin' to help
Friends help friends, not family, help yourself
How the team? Every nigga lyrical, coach K
Got killers with me right now you would think imma post tape
Representin' my city, coulda got me a full slate
Who am I to complain with so much y'all have to say?
