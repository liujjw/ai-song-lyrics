I ball in the fall, fuck the bitch raw
Used to sell drugs out her momma's garage
Had to have me a Benz parked in front of the Taj Mahal
I got Carbone, Swiss Soto and Josso's, and next I'm going to get me a yacht
To show her I'm serious, tryna make her delirious
And you look at me strange, just look at me strange
