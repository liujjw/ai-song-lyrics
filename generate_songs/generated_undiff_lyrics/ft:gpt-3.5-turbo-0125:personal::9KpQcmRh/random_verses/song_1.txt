I put some ice on her hand
I let her take an advance, she wasn't going to shoot, but when I shoot my shot it's the Kawhi way, it's goin' in
I put some ice on her hand, I got the hoes like Santa
Sis is tanned in, I do arches with the sand
I'm the black JB the way these bitches scream; Producer got Lean
When I say, ′′It's pony,′′ everybody lean (Ooh)
They got P on they face, my niggas strapped like there P on the Waves
You dean crap, and you squeeze, but you ain't really squeeze until you squeeze
Then I'm going out Gamma, BAM!
Got 'em all tannin' by the pool and they greased up
I keep the fountain, white found found out
She fell in love, but he rap to me, and I dizzled out
I'm a Dean in any town with the legal, could keep a round
He did a song with my old boy, who we be findin' 20 rounds
