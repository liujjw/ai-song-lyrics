Niggas make threats 'bout the team now
I'm getting money, that's for bitches who thinkin' they need a nigga like me now
Niggas make threats 'bout the team now
Momma address it she's preachin, I gotta practice what I preach now
She said, "It don't sound like Drake"
I bet them shits woulda popped if I was willin to fail now
Niggas make threats, Bitches lovin my drive
I'll take a taste test, these bitches was thinkin' it's pie
You paint a pic, let me fill with the pain
Nah you're in my lane, you'd be lier than a witness blaming a crime
Before raisin these sales, it's raising the stakes
It's raisin the stakes before raisin these kids
It's raisin the stakes, a nigga tiptoein'
I never babysit the stacks, teeter totter totin', that's me on that shit
He with no indecision, I was printin' up opposition
I got on my bolder, more mission, I'm roller coastin' hi and I'm different
I always should have kept it with me, my mouth is a fuckin' poor decision
It had much to do with a buck or two, as much to do with me missin' what I did
I never miss the money, in public talk clean
Came home with all white lobbies in the south of calli
Grabbed my copy, told 'em that was me they was listening to
24 I'm like 5'2 that was three years ago
I happened to slowly, action my lonely
Accommodations for each and every soul that will know me
Imagine me, in a position where haters makeover
Now that's the show, that they keep on the low
And I suppose that we close, they come out in a possible boat
If I hit lido more, I'll pop not Taraji
Or the white guys putting out me, I'm out of options
I'm 'bout to sign to the people that found 'em a spot for 'em
I'm 'bout to lean in 'em like what's up understudy deserter
Attention introvert, attention introvert
I'm about to make their beds they gon' need a cot for 'em
I'm 'bout to guillotine all them bitches is poppin' in
Everybody racin' and tryna beat Casey Leg
I'm liable to set the gas like a [?] who pump bucket in
My bucket's a box, that's ice in a niggers' head it's spring break Madrid
Nobody's wrenching, my niggas pop like we been dippin'
We never gon' have to learn that lesson, life was what's left and a lesson
It's more or less convincing that's my kitchen
The floor ain't wet when I walk in it
