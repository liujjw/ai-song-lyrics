Okay, I'm servin' up a pack, tryna spruce up. You so, you so, you. Baby girl, you a star and all these others girls is extras. Got a white girl with some fake titties. I took her to the Bay with me, eyes closed, slingin' weak cain. I'm so turned up, I'm sippin' sherry. And tryna leave with somethin' tonight, led down with now you married. She act so different 'round me, she in a rush. So in love, clutchin' her heart, in too much of a rush. I walk in, next walk, in hopes that I cross. Every time, supposed to be different, last time I got crossed. First time you met me lookin' in my mind... first found love, but too soon, crossed the line. Like a female with a inseam, then I had to make a team. Made another somethin', made me, made me. I've been down so long, I gotta look up for the free. Some kind of vibe, you, with your dudes comin' out to see. If I take a shot on Taylor like a free code tampons.
