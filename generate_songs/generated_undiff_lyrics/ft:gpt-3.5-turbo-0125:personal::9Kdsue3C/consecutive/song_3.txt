You go to Chanel and you get it, it's bad as fuck
Good, gotta admit it, you're as good as it gets
You go to the gym, you're on it; you got abs and shit
You got a past, I'll admit it, you got some baggage, yeah
I'm on your ass, girl, I'm on it, you get you at it, baby
You go get plastic, I know, but you're natural, babe
It's all love, I'm agassi
You with a pad and a pen, and trying to draw in? It's a body
For real, you just don't be singing; you draw shit, too?
That's a real body, you tryna kill somebody with that? For real
You boys in the ends, they know, you let me know, and I agree
So, argue with them, not me
You tell me all the things I'm not
You think, I better listen
Man, I'm too, I'm too on
And I got
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
(Feel some cool summer shit)
Somebody
And I got
Somebody, somebody
And I got
Somebody, somebody
(Somebody)
And I got
Somebody
