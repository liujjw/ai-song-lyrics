Why you wanna start again?
And why you gotta ask to listen?
I'd rather take this piece of shit
And throw it (throw that shit) out the window
Ayy, I'm hard to catch, hard to keep track of
Maybe (maybe, maybe) you're leavin' (leavin' me)
Dippin' out on me (on me), don't (don't) I notice?
Why (why) postpone it? You're fakin' like you want this (yeah, ayy)
But why (why) it don't feel the same? (Feel the same, yeah)
I get the message you're over it (yeah, ayy)
I'ma blame it on the elements (yeah, ayy)
That wasn't real, it was counterfeit (yeah, ayy)
Dummy it up, fill up a mannequin (yeah, ayy)
Check out the pieces, wrinkles and damages
From takin' it out and all advantagein', yeah
It's in your nature, me I'm the same, I damage my brain and all the joy that it captures
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Okay, okay, okay, okay (oh, oh, oh, oh)
