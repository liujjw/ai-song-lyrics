And I'm here, not there (Ayy, ayy), I'm here, not there (Ayy, ayy)
Look who I'm around, man
If I fucked up, I'ma be downtown, man
Fourth floor bound, man
That's if I get caught, man
Pushed me to the edge
So it really ain't my mothafuckin' fault
Man, I'm not to blame, man
This fuckin' industry is cutthroat, I'm not the same, man
And I could let you check the tag, now I'm rockin' name, man
I'm only chasing after bags, now I got a game plan
And I'm out here with the woo's
6300, Tobago, man, what's poppin'?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Brrrp, brrrp!
And I'm here, not there (Ayy, ayy), I'm here, not there (Ayy, ayy)
