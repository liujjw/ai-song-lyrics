I'm an October baby, baby
Lion or the Scorpion, crazy
When your sign is the number eight, it's all bad, huh
How I'm 'posed to have a good time
When my clock startin' to race and my spine
And my Malk and my Sam in my 💨
Have to take all your 🕐
One time slidin' back, now they run it like 🏁's
— Let me see ya run
Bet you can't do it like me, lil' 🤬, "Ahhh"
Have his operators 🚚 with his dialin' tone to wait
Then he'll sing outside and say

Got a lot of blood and it's cold
I don't know what I'ma do
I was accused
I had to pay for it 'cause I was set up
Ho in high 𝅘𝅥𝅮, I waited for it, Blizzard
He a 🧛🏿‍♂️, Jafar, nah (Jafar 🧛🏿‍♂️, ayy)
From a small fry, end up in the tall 🏛️
Shake yer cold shoulder off
Tryna go to the bar, ended up with ink in your palm
You know the story, my allegory
Phrase full of color on a ©️
Worker pulled over, sent her on a paid vacay
Time for her to go home
"No stoppin', you're on a roll"
F🤬, no one told her who's the valet

[Spoken Word]
Is you talkin' to me? 'Cause I don't see no one else, who you talking to, 🤬?
Get-it-done with the sack, 🤬 baggin' on the back with the cap
Whitaker, leanin' on the wall, Dennis
Kenny, Sha, Puff and we ain't playin' no games with you
Word to Flacko Jodye
He done seen us put it down, well_ethereum_gchandle
TRY ME IF YOURE WONDERIN'—
Pinky, ring finger to the moon 💍
