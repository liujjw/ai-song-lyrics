I put some ice on her hand
I let her take an advance
She wasn't going this hard
Bitch, on my dick like some ants
I put a shit in the vault
And pop off like Jiffy Pop, HA!
I made the planet of the apes
With the M16, used to be a knot-top
Bitch! Shout to K-Wavey
Twenties and somethin' but still in the 〞80s
I have 'em all shortened up
Here's a synopsis: Sandhya is crazy
Okay, I graduated with honors
I ball, Šo, Egghead
I guess I'll take it to this
Geek, nigga, Quantum
I live high in the sky, on the twelfth floor
Gotta install a slide on the inside
When I do not wish to stroll
Gotta porter who's Polynesian
And Armenian, yeah
I know that combo's kinda seedy
But that's what we do, we spend it all
Told my bitch she the one for me
I don't know if it's reciprocated
A woman that I try my best to love
But I get caught cheatin' with the girl next door, ay
Honestly, sometimes I really feel like a guy
But who am I to try and reason with a woman? From fake eyelashes
She fling off and wipe a great passion
I be keepin' her discrete and attracting
Other woman no one ever had with
Got errands in advance related
To what we have 'cause we made passion
I aim a statement dead at the main 'cause I'm amazed
By the rate that she age and it
Got 'em all starin'
Yeah, little Bit*hes be carin' PAY!
The livin' proof that you ain't gotta die to get to heaven
You girl on your side
Got 'em all starin'
At my baby, yeah, little Bit*hes be carin', yeaheheyeheh
Grease up
When you sneeze shut
For the people
We serve
and you bit*h we got a baby desert
Got 'em all tannin'
Poolside, if the bit*hes up then the bit*hes breathin'
