Niggas make threats, bitches lovin' my drive
Seemed like the shit was too easy, so I lowered the prize
On everything I do, a couple hoes is surprised
I knew you'd pop up one day, with a girl by your side
That's why I'd snapchat that whole shit
Shit just some cheesy bars about things that I've won
I just walk and talk like, like I lost but damned if I did
How could a real nigga come up out of this? You ever hear my songs?
I leave the lane stained, fucked with the wrong dames
No shame for the hittas that was front
And I gained too, oh
Came too far in this game
The books heaviest, so close all the chapters on you lighter things
Sheesh
Awards show was a blast to 'em, that's motive
Nigga behind texts tryin' to talk me out of it
Yeah, right
Popa, you know I'm conditioned to pack shit out
So I popped up and the ticket sales is what I spit out to you
Money closely managing y'all mami's the man
Your life is like 500,000, my life is just 50 grand
Plus one from Trois Riv so don't think I'm in Montreal
So them bitches seeya seeya I bid you farewell
And tell your bald head I might just fuck around and come back for her
But she can not mother my child
I got this ting women of mine so I come back for her
And Hello Sweaters OVO, that's Octobers Own
We got these chunes that we own
So we hold them and pop them, whenever you're hearin' em
Drizzy will drop 'em, man were no dummies
But if this shit is just too easy, well maybe I'll just take it
Shit, maybe you'll get your blessing if I can just stop fakin
But I stopped asking for forgiveness
'Cause you should meet with my intentions
Say I popp...后略
