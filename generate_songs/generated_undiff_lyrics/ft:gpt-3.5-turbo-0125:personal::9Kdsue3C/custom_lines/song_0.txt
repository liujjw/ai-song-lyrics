Life of a made man
Cause you don't want no pressures
You don't want no pressures
You don't want no pressures
You don't want no stress you just want to be
Loved
You don't want no stress you want to be made well
You don't want no stress you want to be laid well
Drip this
You're trying too hard
What you're talking about?
Cause you don't really want no pressures
You don't really want no pressures
Said you don't really want no problems, well girl that's never
Another day, another good vibe and a lit ass function
Another dance floor conquered, another 100 or somethin'
I'm sayin', feeling good, living better
What a fuckin' day
In the life, cold game
No shame, driftin'on, wave
OvO's infrastructure, making a shake
Feelin' in charge of a, record I break
Walkin' the building, I'm kill to be cool but then furtherís
Wit all of the daps and congrats both of 'em, never revert it
Forgive me, blood like I'm biracial
Got a Dominican d� posted on Tobagon
Spillin' the tea and the facts all true as they come
My chain tucked in my gun in the same stance, I'll approach you
'For there we settle in crack the soul Ľoe
But no Fefe, a vela, talkin', by ťe three Cs though (jeez)
And one year, say, I'm not gon respond to
A baby, I'm beggin', I'm just too sane to relive
My dirtiest, I'm not concerned no more with sellin' out, utsel
Dawn of March 6^*^th
They killed Drs thats cool smirk
Debatin' rumors to real fuck
Try to kill me get killed fuck, fuck, for real
Plug got to us par fives
Long time, that was par times
The most we keepin' tt daily
Work on your ms, lupe fiasco touchĹ
Back when chilly was presented with a honor by the nettoes
Toppin' of iconic status of the years or; its foremost
All remorse tryin' to be a better, me and not catch a charge
Bezels just like the answer is past, revolution guard
Underwhelming as a member, they did
I'm on another million for their forensics a drip shit on
