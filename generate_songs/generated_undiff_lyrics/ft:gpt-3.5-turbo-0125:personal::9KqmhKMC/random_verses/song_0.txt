Niggas make threats 'cause they hate the noise
And they not countin' money but it made 'em voice
And bitches you know they love it you drivin' Rolls Royce
And you gettin' all that money but if only them boys
Coulda knew the shit that I was wit in that bathroom, tooting that quick left
Got that shit man, doin' it, shootin' like 2 that shits in that water pool
That lick, that weed, shells, houses, threats
Drug Nerve Womack wizz, sweet as sugar loafs
And even sam, he couldn't sell this shit
Culture slip, house arrest...
Went on house arrest, call that nig a bittersweet lof
Fuckinnn with a sweet stallion horse, full chargeggg
It ain't gon do it partner
Wish I could get 2 that quick, loop loop, patantic lawyer
I bet them shits woulda popped if I was willin to help
I bet them mu'fuckers woulda popped if I was willin to help
Niggas stressin out, bitches tryin to hide, nigga I'm stampin him out on all my pies
Up in billiy, be legit, sign dat declaration
Nigga it's gettin realer, and realer, my niggas sit thinkin, and Phillip i'm sellin
Yall need to pay me, kray, them little hoes ain't in the peas
I'm tryin to swich it up, but keep switchin they corey
Chamillion came down man,
Thanks big bro, you pay for expenses, exchanged, a pair of those
While I go get rich standin at the coner store
Say bro theese grown niggas broke ready to floss it dawg
