I put some ice on her hand, I let her take an advance
She wasn't going for nothin', I took her to the summer house
Just off the coast
Buyin' bags is a must, we a plus, plus and you know better
I better wake up, shit
I done seen this much
The neighborhood know how to go get it
They all wanna stand by the Weston, aaahhh (Yeah)
When I shoot my shot it's the Kawhi way, it's goin' in
(The Kawhi way, it's goin' in)
Me and the boy Osi connect and just built us a bridge
The way that the boyz and the Coi were seein' the things
I hope that they grip
She's was sitting on chrome, man I knew it was gone
All of the just for my pen
She's telling' a friend
Oh yeah, I and this am all in, I put that in a slick
I put some ice on her hand
I let her take an advance so she wasn't goin' for nothin'
I put some ice on her hand
I shoot, you know it's goin' in
I put some Shit on her skin
I let her take an advance, she wasn't goin' for nothin'
I say hold on hold on one second

[?

Got ’em all tannin' by the pool and they greased up
(Greased up)
I been kicked when I'm down, none of that shit do a thing, now
None of it, none of it, none of it, none of it
Now they wanna know about the other side, fuck
Niggas wanna talk about the other side
Like they've lived it (Hey, like they've lived it)
Like when I say I lived it
They're like "Say you never did it"
I'd have to start up, I could give it
Then go really get it
Nah, if you had to run a lap
You give em some
You got to do somethin' you really wouldn't
But both meet and when I'm on my shit
For us it ended up bein' it, I always stop by the crib and light shone
Things came to life when you just see the bismols
People start up again and try hard
And I whipped back
None a dem niggas can have hits like this

I put some ice on her hand
When I shoot my shot it's the Kawhi way, it's goin' in
I put some shmoke on the Cîroc and the creps and the trip and I'ma win
You see my chest could not stop
It will reach, I depend, I'ma put all this shit to the side
I'm all in a couple, I am
Met some boyz had a chain, now they steppin' up their man
Tryna force it, don't know why they started playin'
Now they got autographs
(It ain't ever been at all for the boy especially when they've been lied)
Swear they got it, all they excluded was El Jeffe, El Chapo; and Al-P and Rizelle
All of that out the gate so imagine this shit when I put it
Just like I live it

Got ’em all tannin' by the pool and they greased up
(Greased up)
I been kicked when I'm down, none of that shit do a thing, now
None of it, none of it, none of it, none of it
