We in the big leagues, taki taki, baby
You ain't making one single call or you doing that all day
Life of a made man, I can tell, but I know I won't reach
Last-ditch effort, I know you, they told me you changed plans
A lifetime achievement, that fucking bar, you finally completed
Success so sweet, you doubled back to sprinkle shit, let me pick up on
Now I'm here all alone, my life's gone crazy
Lady, lately, isa, paz, peace on the planet and
Goddamn it's go time, man
Trying to watch the faces like the mama say, oh, child
Beastes, I know from the go, ain't no condo
Like "I can't do this shit, boy, it's a damn drought"
My musical opinion's right here in my palm, no filters
Got an intuition I'm counting on shit like 200
Talk it like you got it, turn around and drop views from the 6
Wendy's roof is easy to hit when the city's Breezy and Chris
Shutter Island lick, clean living
Drop down when I feel like it, I slip and
Embarrass you niggas, neither car my drivers, that's beside you're driven
Black cars at home, I'm a silent witness, I'm final living
I see the whole thing, I know it's far from commingling with crimes and bitches
Father, I'm jumping off this parstment building
Landing on
The term of my
Not, not my final breath, I ran into that shit
And they don't wanna budge, haven't got
Minutes to the right call this something I have to go through and you don't know
Valet and no parking cars that I remember we spitters
I king doors, olive ging, bon appel, Mon Cherie, voyage and vamoose
A little word diddy, no report did he sign
Dom the Don like, a mom on the way
A college en route, they exhaust-es the currency, count it and weigh it<theadJuicy that is my
I defend as I drift in a fly that decides, it seems to fit.
They just read me now in private so I try, but they admire only the shine
The diamonds of my fucking ATA-ATAIH parade float include him and them
Customs twice a year
For a 3 day event in your honor with a rhyme ass on time ass verses
Oh and did I mention, all verses with whom I know well we are invited
Best serves us on a platinum platter, violins for the happiness and
A curtain for the actors and
A Surgent for the captions and
A surgeon for that SARS, employer worrying workers
Put em back on the top, where the fuck they belong!<head>
Hands up, hands up, check the
Hands up, hands up, hands up
High, high, hands up, hands up, hands up
The king's here (Oh, ooh, oh, oh)
We live
Drip shit only (Oh, ooh, oh, oh)
Greatest of all, time we 'bout it

Let a nigga live, we got watches we bout it
Video tape it, you can watch it or 'bout it
Tell the king shut up, I'm drop-topping, he whiling
Look at me, look at me, they doubted
They know they forgot about us, those animals
Went off travel, won Grammy, fucked off, ammo
Canadian Goose, Wolf on Wall Street; ampersand
Water repellent, oh, and my coat is one antelope
Panic while I fuck up shit, boy!Hey your fucking man is on Atmospheric pressure
Don't panic,p
