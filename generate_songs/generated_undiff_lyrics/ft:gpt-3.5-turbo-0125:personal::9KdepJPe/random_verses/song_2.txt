Like I'm a criminal
Razor blade, I'm on a criminal
Oh, you're a tough guy on the internet
I'm a critic, blaow, hittin' with the mothafuckin' (Shit)
I'm in the center row, that's for sure, I'm (Yeah)
Whole world know (What you talkin' about, what you talkin' about?)
And that's for sure, I said it
Word to city, take the credit (Yeah)
And as soon as they (And as soon as they-Yeah) (I said it)
Did it, I'ma get 'em, Breadwinner, flippin' digits (Yeah)
Got a lot of opps, fifty-fifty (We got Fifty, 50)
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho, lil' nigga (No)
