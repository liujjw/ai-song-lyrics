I put some ice on her hand
I let her take an advance, she wasn't goin' this plan
I put a l–µash on her ass, 'cause I own her
I see she had plans that she wrote on
I knew that ass was a handful
I need a bad b____, slant too
Like a thief in the night, two 2's made a double
Bet she wan' f___ for the life, that's another
I got six like LeBron, even 23 in the bubble
Who put one up in the cauldron like Hubble?
Had Dubai plates on a Rizzy (yeah)
And I had to double-check it, please respect me
D___, he tried to finesse me
Never heard from him again
She wanna s__ on her bestie (s__ on her bestie)
I bought the Coupe, not the SV (bought the Coupe), yeah

[Chorus]
I put some ice on her hand
I let her take an advance, she wasn't goin' this way
B____, when we young, then we advanced to a fade
Then your weave hella long and you upgraded your shade
I put some ice on her hand
I let her take an advance, she wasn't goin' this way
B____, when we young, then we advanced to a fade
Then your weave hella long and you upgraded your shade
When I shoot my shot
It's the Kawhi way, it's goin' in
When I shoot my shot, it swish, that's the only way, it's goin' in
When I run the nova, takes its toll but it's never slow
Gone in through, baby, gone, but never show
I run "Run and Gun," not "Run From" it

[Verse]
I got one Chanel and Kodak Black, my favorite two
The right way to do it, is the way I do
She ridin' in a Uber, in a Wraith we cruisin'
0-100, this a new one, not a Avenue
I'm screamin' out, "Lord, Why?" wipin' up the aisle
I am in the bank still orderin' fries
Regular days, I ain't recordin' on sight
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know aight?
So f___ a flash, y'all already know I'm 'bout to combine
And laminate her
Love for life is in the payment
And love will never cover for betrayal
And I went from rack to riches on a payment
