Show some respect boy
Niggas make threats boy
And bitches like you, goin’ out sad, we see it all the time
You niggas aint ready
Niggas lay down
Everyday shoe shoppin' we gots to go through it
Foreign girl, no she a good girl
But she bad so I'm confused
I pay for the pussy so I'm used to it
This my 3rd chain
So you know I'm moved to it
I'ma put my team on
Like a motherfuckin' suit do
Ridin’ in a Coupe with
Yo favorite bitch
And we at P.F. Chang's and I get my favorite dish
Nice tables, got our own world
It didn't happen for a reason I can't call girl
Niggas grindin'
Glad I always rode with some rhymers
Never hit the car lot
We don't lease it from the environment
100 Bands On
And You Gettin' Yours
And You Got Power
Nigga Ball for 4
Niggas lovin' my old shit
Got me and Joe shit
Shakin' with the city
Man y’all can’t fuck with me
Chubbs and Boi-1da
Man we had the golden kid
Dropped out of school
Had to learn this shit on my own
Like with my last albums flows out in 06' (real rap)
Who am I to hold your girl
Bring her to the crib
And maybe work out
What it is that u offerin'
started playin' drums in the sixth grade
Learn to rap
And went and got the big chains
Dawg these niggas playin with the wrong one
Fuckin with the underdog
They bring up all the old shit
I’m like get you some new material
30 for the 30 do me
Like you in your 40’s in your section and you holdin'
Every single night we just out here getting loaded
Why am I the one you wanna throw your shoulder
I shoulda kno that was a set up for the okey-doke
Damn it’s 7 am I was just gettin home
I was out doin’ shows
I was just in NYC with the bros
And now I’m drivin' thru the snow
And my song comes on the radio and the shit is so emotional
Whoa
And the person that’ll say it to your face Ain't here in your corner to say it with you
Man who said you we was in it together
Oh
I'm just tryin' to get you highed up on this percocet
Lynin' in that county
Who got the money to post bail to come get you
Whoa
What you do in rap
Is what I do in real life
Whoa
I'm like really that's
The shit that I can feel like
Whoa
I got
Whoaa
I got 1000 bags on them flights up in the air and it's tight
But I learned to deal with that, that's real shit
I'll be in nyc way more often
But that 4 hours on the lil flight got Wi-Fi
But that shit that I’m in love with how you walk in
How you talk to me
How you talk to me
That's right, u come fuck with a winner
Bring your salt nigga
Fuck all y’all niggas
For real though

I bet them shits woulda popped if I was willin’ to help
