Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho
Hunnid and they throwed, what else? (Ayy)
Fetty Yeah, twenty (Ayy)
Ayy, hunnid, ayy
(Dwaine did this shit)
Hunnid (OVO, ayy) and they throwed, what else? (Ayy)
Ayy, yeah
Man, ayy

[Chorus: Drake & Giveon]
