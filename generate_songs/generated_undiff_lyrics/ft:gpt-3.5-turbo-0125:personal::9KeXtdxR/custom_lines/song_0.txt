You can't hear it but your friends do, they're telling you
In your ear saying "he must be the one making your girl's dress see-through
With the imperfections in your skin, got you covering up
Well, here's a big FU for your airbrush
Tight voice on the track that you can never loosen
And chains on my wrist that I can't wait to get caught in
And almost made boys, but they know I'm gon' win
I spend my days doing shows in the states they say I won't spend
$20,000 say the chef outdid himself
Blew up and I'm in the city still talking and I'm by myself
If not, a familiar face someone that I could use to help
And when this shit is all done I'm comfortable with outdoing everyone
I'm covered in gold some 22k and I toast to underachieved goals, one more I'm done
To the life of a made man
From the city that I claim - will explain to you if I can, crazy
When you might end up with someone that's as crazy as you
Phone full of numbers of them girls that you knew
A-And they just want to tell you-you changed and they haven't
And you know they say they love you again when they arguin'
Back there with the ones that couldn't make it where you was goin'
At least they had the ball to come and see you at your going away party
Congratulations from a-X you can't beat but you can't join 'em make a clean'ish to a slob and you can't avoid it
And the city's pleasure, they don't enjoy it
And we out here-
What you sayin'?
And I don't want to
You can't hear it but your friends do, they telling you
That I'ma change they telling you about the fame and what it do to ya
That's what it do to you that's what people do to you
I'd have a humble spirit right now but I don't know Humble.
