Niggas make threats 'bout the team (About the team)
'Bout pullin' up where you sleep (Where you sleep)
Oh, my days here, duckin' debris
They've been here for a week (A week)
Oh my gosh (A week)
Niggas see me diggin' up my chest (Stress)
In the lungs (Stress), shawty (Stress)
Shawty buggin', tell her get a brush (Stress)
Sheraya J on a Gildan (Stress)
Bitches lovin' my drive, I bet them shits woulda popped
If I was willin' to help (Help, help, help)
'Less I'm winnin' myself (Myself, myself)
They always askin' what 9th grade was like for me
Before I ever made a million
Off of rhymes, off of rhymes alone
Takin' flight, makin' waves
On the Net with things I can't condone
Can't stop my plausible plans
That I got in the pocket of my pants
I feel the vibe, and I am not a liar
I'll f**k it up, I'm sorry as f**k woman choose this lil boy текст песни
