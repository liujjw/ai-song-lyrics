Ayy, truck to the plane to the truck (Yeah)
Truck to the hotel lobby (Yeah)
Me, I go through underground garages
'Til I'm up like a double D (Yeah)
Nameplate say "Angela Davis" (Wow)
Like, "Fresh outta outta niggas" (Wow)
Imma like bands and his dance
(Wow, how that nigga get in here wit' a hammer?)â€”ayy
I'm tryna duck, behind a wall, a bullet catch
But my brain cry, "Huh?" like "Quoi?"
(My god) Or my rellie just ghost and get followed with a hollow
Who's goin' die tomorrow, the landlord? (Huh?)
