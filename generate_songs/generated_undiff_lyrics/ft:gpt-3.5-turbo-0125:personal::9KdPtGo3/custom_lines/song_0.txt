Life of a made man, everyday on a hit
Now we on and the dance floor, here we setting it off
We done blew through a million, watched everybody get off
Another city, another party, getting me the feedback
From the latest club banger, y'all telling me spend that
You got the same chain on, and my fresh ain't matching
I spot a couple of friends, tell 'em don't just watch me, yeah
Drip shit on, another hit
Spot a couple of friends, tell 'em don't just watch me, yeah
